Don't Dis My Ability- A new perspective on solo traveling

## Track: Travel

## üí° Inspiration

Post pandemic has seen a tremendous surge in people's inclination towards solo traveling and "workstation" and the era of solo traveling has also experienced a rise in specially-abled solo travelers stepping out and exploring the world. In researching the solo travel experiences and issues faced by specially-abled travelers, we identified two major problems faced by the people which are:

i) Getting Money and Using The ATM- Even after carrying sufficient local currency, many specially-abled travelers are bound to use the ATM at least once to retrieve cash and in situations like these, many travelers have to either reach out to a fellow traveler or a staff member of accommodation and trusting them with sensitive banking information.

ii) Difficulty in ordering food- Travelling to countries with diverse cultures is often reflected in the diverse variety of dishes available and this can often cause a problem of not knowing what to eat especially for a specially-abled person having vision and hearing impairments.

## üíª What it does

To make solo travel convenient for specially-abled people we bring to you "Don't Dis My Ability" a web app working on ensuring a smooth and easy-going solo travel experience for the differently-abled people. The website uses Google Vision API for OCR implementation to retrieve the necessary information from the menu at a restaurant and clusters the data into vegetarian and non-vegetarian categories alongside displaying the calories in the dish. This also ensures the screen reading technology is not being fooled and only focuses on necessary information making the process of ordering food at a restaurant simplified for the specially-abled traveler.
The web app also allows micropayment to bypass the hassle of making visits to the ATMs and sharing sensitive banking information with strangers for help by allowing direct payment from native currency via payment gateways.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How we built it

- Figma: For design
- DeSo: For user authentication
- React.js: For frontend
- Python: For backend
- Google Vision API: OCR

## ‚úà Travel Track

Our team embarked on a journey to create an adaptive user interface for specially-abled people that made it easier for them to use technology whenever they travel abroad. We spearheaded the project by creating a platform that allows users to:

- Upload the menu and extract the information from it
- Convert the extracted text from the menu into speech
- Allow micropayments to be made using Razorpay
- Classify the food as vegetarian or non-vegetarian
- Get nutrition information about the food, such as its ingredients and its calories
- Change the language of the website to the user's preferred language

## üìö Research

Research is paramount to gaining a full understanding of the user and their needs. Beyond our own experiences, we needed to dig deeper into the web, outside of our network, and find both organizations that could shed light on how better to help our targeted users as well as to conduct research into other similar applications or products. This was crucial to avoid re-inventing the wheel and wasting valuable time and resources. Here are a few of the resources that were helpful to us:

## ü§ù Most Creative Use of GitHub

We are using GitHub for the following reasons:

- **Collaboration**: GitHub makes it easy to share code with others and helps a lot in collaboration.
- **GitHub Project**: We also used GitHub for planning and keeping track of our project and its progress with the help of the GitHub project management tool.
- **Implementing the CI/CD workflow**: GitHub makes it easy to implement the CI/CD workflow and makes the deployment process easy.
- **Deploying the project**: Deploying the project on GitHub helped us to get the project deployed on the network to be accessed by other people.
- **Using PRs and Issues**: We are doing multiple PRs and building multiple issues to keep on track of the project.

## üîê Best Use of DeSo

We are using **DeSo** to make a secure user authentication. DeSo is the first Layer 1 blockchain custom-built for decentralized social media applications.

## üåê Best Domain Name from Domain.com

- dontdismyability.tech

## üß† Challenges we ran into

- Due to the difference in the time zone it was a bit difficult to collaborate with other developers in the team but we managed to get the project done in time.
- Complete the project in the given time frame.

## üìñ What we learned

- Collaboration with other developers.

## üöÄ What's next for Don't Dis My Ability

- Building a mobile app for the project.
- Simplifying the process of accommodation by providing a proper description of rooms, advancing eliminating the graphic capture and overcrowding of webpages, following international standards on color contrasts, etc.
